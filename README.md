Glistening buttons light up the screen in their unique shades of red, green, yellow, and blue. Your task is clear â€“ replicate the sequence by tapping the buttons in the exact same order. Success is your guide to unlocking new levels and advancing further into the heart-pounding gameplay. You can play the game here: https://emrekaanusta.github.io/Simon-Game/
